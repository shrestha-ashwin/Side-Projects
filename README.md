# Side-Projects
This repository contains my smaller projects. This is the place where I upload many of my small trials based on what I learned in my classes, 
and on the internet.

Testimonial Project: This project is made using CSS and HTML. It is layout for the testimonial part of the page. The design idea is of frontendmentor-challenge, but the coding is all done by me.
